xHLA_R
================================================================
The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene complex on human chromosome
6 is one of the most polymorphic regions in the human
genome, and contributes in large part to the diversity of the immune
system. Accurate typing of HLA genes with short read sequencing
data has historically been difficult due to the sequence similarity between
the polymorphic alleles.  xHLA iteratively refines the mapping results at
the amino acid level to achieve 99 to 100% 4-digit typing accuracy for both
class I and II HLA genes, taking only about 3 minutes to process a 30X
whole genome BAM file on a desktop computer.


Background to this fork
------------
We had issues getting the main repo for xHLA to work via the main docker-based repo, so we performed a quick and dirty stripdown of the code to make it work for us. The original scripts have been hacked slightly and we've added some control scripts that should be easy to run via R or R studio. Some files needed to be moved around as the stripped out scripts typer.r and typer.sh were looking in the wrong place and it was easier to move the targets than to change the scripts. 

This is intended to run as a batch mode process that will perform HLA typing on all of the fastq files in the input directory. At the end it generates a tidy table of results data. Along the way it deletes all the files except for the final json files. Obviously some of those files might be useful to some people, but for our purposes we are happy just to save disk space and keep the final typing data. To change this behaviour just edit the R scripts to take out the rm command calls to the system.

We have found that the typing algorithm works reproducibly given a sample of 15000 reads from MiSeq 2*300 data that was generated from exons amplified using the methods described by Lange, V. et al BMC Genomics. 2014; 15: 63. http://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-15-63

The R script calls seqtk to pull out a random sample of reads from each of the two read files. The same random seed is used to pull read 1 and read 2 so that the reads remain paired. You can change the number of reads that are pulled by changing the number in the two lines beneath "#randomly sample n reads from the fastq files" in the xHLA.R file

The xHLA.R script will read the FASTQ files, sample 15000 reads using seqtk, then forward the data to  bwa, samtools and the xHLA typer script before pulling the reports in and making a nice tidy data table that you can read in R. 



Installation
------------

Download this repo to your computer. 

Ensure that you have installed the burrows wheeler aligner (BWA), the diamond aligner and seqtk (sequence toolkit).

We use Macs, so homebrew is our method of choice for installing these dependencies

>brew install bwa  
>brew install diamond  
>brew install seqtk  
  
Install the R packages you will need. Some of these are native, but always worth checking.
i.e. in R

>install.packages("jsonlite")  
>install.packages("lpSolve")  
>install.packages("data.table")  
>install.packages("parallel")  
>install.packages("IRanges")  
  
IMPORTANT - The reference fasta file needs to be in place if you want this to work. 

Download a fasta reference file for chromosome 6 or the MHC region. You could use this one http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/chromosomes/chr6.fa.gz

Put the fasta file in the chr6/ folder

The R script will check to see if you have indexed your reference. If not it will automatically run the burrows wheeler aligner to index it. If you need to do it by hand for any reason, this command should achieve what you need

>bwa index -a bwtsw chr6.fa

IMPORTANT - The diamond reference database file (hla.dmnd) needs to be built with your own system version of diamond. The script will do this automatically at the start of each batch run. If you need to do this by hand, then the commands are simply.

>cd data  
>diamond makedb --in hla.faa -d hla  


Running the xHLA_R script
------------
Put your paired end read fastq files in the input folder  
Run the xHLA_R.R script (either through R, Rstudio or from the command line

Command Line
>Rscript xHLA_R.R

Command Line in background with log
>nohup Rscript xHLA_R.R &

the report files will go to nohup.txt and you can monitor the progress with
>tail -f nohup.txt


Output files
------------

Output 1 is tab delimited text file *000_alldata_out.txt* of all the data you've pushed through the system. New runs are appended to this file so be aware that if you re-run the test on the same pair of fastq files, you will have two lines matching that specimen.
